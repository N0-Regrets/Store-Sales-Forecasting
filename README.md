# Store Sales Forecasting
## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview).
The competition involved predicting sales for the thousands of product families sold at different Favorita stores located in Ecuador.  
My solution achieved an **RMSLE** score of **0.4453** on the test set.
